# My Awesome Projects

Welcome to my project portfolio, this site is built using Docsify and showcases some of my work.

## Featured Projects

Here are a few highlights:

* **[Senior Project:](seniorProject2016.md)**  Senior Project at Cal Poly Pomona 2016.  Bi-directional transmission of torque through software.
* **[Dual Battery E Bike:](dualBatteryEBike.md)** LiFePo and SuperCapacitor dual chemistry EV bike.  Supercapacitors have 10x the power output but <1/10th the capacity of LiFePo.  Using both chemistries does introduce design challendges which are addressed in this project.
* **[Real Time Super Resolution:](realTimeSuperResolution.md)**  Thermal cameras have low resolution which makes it difficult for real time applications.  Photo stacking can be used to increase the resolution but typically is not used in real time.  This project explores how to photo stack in real time using some techniques in FIR filters.
* **[Eye Mouse:](eyeMouse)** This was before VR/AR/XR is a thing.  Nothing beats the arc pixel density of a computer screen.  The intent is that a computer screen will simulate the AR screen depending on the eye movements.  First step to do this is to track the eye movements which is explored in this project. 


## Work in Progress

**[Phaseless BLDC Motor:](phaselessBLDCMotor.md)**]
Currently I am working on what I call a phaseless brushless DC axial flux motor.  3-phase motors are typical because they were born from the 3-phase power generation and distribution.  4-5-6-phase designs were previously explored but the tradeoffs were not worth the increase in complexity.  Time to revisit this "too complex notion".  Many design aspects are changed, but allows for the follow optimizations below.

I'm constantly adding new projects, so be sure to check back often!
